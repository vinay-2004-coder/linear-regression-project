# 🏠 Linear Regression Project

This project was completed as part of José Portilla’s **Python for Machine Learning & Data Science Masterclass** on Udemy.  
It demonstrates how to build and evaluate a **Linear Regression model** to predict house prices based on numerical features.

---

## 📋 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to understand the relationship between different housing features (like area, number of rooms, etc.) and the target variable — house price.

Steps followed:
1. Data Loading & Cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Selection & Scaling  
4. Model Training using Linear Regression  
5. Model Evaluation using R² and RMSE metrics

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to prepare data for machine learning models  
- Building and interpreting a linear regression model using **scikit-learn**  
- Evaluating regression models with statistical metrics  
- Visualizing results with Matplotlib and Seaborn  

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

---

## 📊 Results
- The model achieves good predictive accuracy for house price prediction.
- Evaluation metrics such as **R²**, **MAE**, and **RMSE** are used to measure performance.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Try **Ridge** and **Lasso Regression** for regularization.  
- Add polynomial features for non-linear relationships.  
- Compare model results with tree-based methods.
